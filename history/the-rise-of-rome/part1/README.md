## Introducing early Rome

Ancient city was a city state comprising central settlement and the surrounding territory controlled by it which supported it economically. To be considered urban, a settlement must be large enough to have a degree of economic diversity and specialisation that lifted it beyond  the level of subsistence economy; political organization and social hierarchies and a concept of citizenship or state membership above and beyond membership of a family or kinship group.

The most important civilizations în italy were:
* Latini
* Etruscans(**Etrusci** in latin, **Tyrrhenoi** in greek and maybe **Rassena** in their own language)
  * It not sure what the origins of etruscans are. Their language doesn't resemble italian languages and it may be not indoeurpean. Herodotus says they emigrated from Asia Minor, but other ancient sources disagree with him(Dion; Strabo). Some ancient DNA studies show similarities between etruscans and central Anatolia populations and differences with medieval and modern Tuscans. These studies are controversial at least.
* Greeks

### Bronze Age

During late bronze age(12 - 10th centuries) we can see some changes taking place. We can see the appearance of better manufactured bronze goods which needed skilled specialized craftsmen. Also, the presence of imported greek pottery and the raw materials needed to obtain bronze required a trade network around mediterranean sea. 

We also see the increasing population of settlements and appearing of proto urban settlements. They started to move to easy defensible locations, and we start to see more weaponry type items, meaning that we maybe have a more aggressive period than the early bronze age. We can see in burials that a society stratification's begin to emerge when we find some burials with richer and more grave goods. The most used burial method was cremation.

## Setting the scene: Iron-Age Italy

### Etruria and Villanova culture

#### <u>Villanovan Etruria</u>
Villanovan Etruria shows dynamic economic growth, a restructuring of communities and exploitation of resources. From the middle of 8th century we can see a small number of burials with significantly richer grave goods. This means that an elite has been emerged adding more stratification to the social hierarchies. Varianta of the villanovan culture expanded to Bologna and part of Campania. The population of Iron Age Etruria had an active network of contacts. We can see lots of greek goods(pottery) in graves. Also mining was central to the northern Etruria economy. This created a trading route with phoenicians. We can find phoenicians pottery and metal work in north etruria graves.

#### <u>Latium</u>
The region lagged behind neighbouring Campania and Etruria în development. Latium was neither as fertile as Campania nor as rich în mineral resources as Etruria and was more peripheral to the principal trade routes of the eighth century. We see similarities of social customs and organization, but it developed at a slower pace.

#### <u>Greek and phoenicians in Italy</u>
Some Mycenaean greek pottery is dated as back as 16th century BC.

Phoenicians, a semitic speaking people originating from the area around Tyre and Sindon on the Eastman shores of the mediterranean, played an important role în the commerce of iron-age mediterranean. According to the bible, ships took expeditions lasting up to 3 years from Tyre as early as 10th century, and it's coraborated with findings of Spain and North Africa dating back to 10 century bc. Despite the interests in the west, no phoenician settlement was founded on italy mainland. Thucydides says they occupied small islands of the cost of Sicily for trading.

The earliest permanent greek settlement în Italy was Pithecusae on the island of Ischia(~750). It was founded by greeks from the island of Euboea. The islands weren't best suited for agriculture. They opted for this for the position on the trading route linking Mediterranean with Sardinia and Italy, an important and well-established route of exchange of metals and metal ores. Greece was not rich în mineral deposits. Ischia had role is confirmed by a complex which contained 3 buildings for smelting Iron, bronze and lead. The cemetery shows luxury goods from all over the mediterranean: greek vases, egyptian scarabs, phoenician seal Stones and 'Nestor Cup'. 

The Nestor Cup shows the awareness of Homer legends in Italy of the 8th century. Funerary evidence shows that the local population continue to live side by side with the newcomers.

#### <u>Greek settlements în southern Italy</u>
Towards the end of 8 century the nature of greek settlements in Italy changed, and the number of greeks migrating these began to increase. The ancient resources present the establishment of greek settlements as well-organized colonisation process, undertaken by fully developed city-states. This is debatable because the city state were not fully developed. The motivation of the mass migration is probably a desire for large arable land, although we can find greek colonies that had a commercial purpose. 

The arrival of greek settlers în Campania and southern Italy brought italian population in contact with new cultural and economic influences which changed elite's tastes but did not significantly affect the development of italian societies.


## Trojans, Latins, Sabines and rogues: Romulus, Aeneas and the ‘foundation’ of Rome

According to romans, the city of Rome was founded on 21 April around 750 bc by a latin named Romulus. He oversaw the establishment of a thriving city, then disappeared after a 38 years reign. The Foundation story involving Romulus and Remus, the descendants of Aeneas form an important strand in Roman culture and history.

### Archaeology

#### <u>Middle Bronze Age</u>
The early settlements here are not surprising. The site offers many natural advantages: the seven hills provided defensible locations for settlements, control over major routes of communication between Etruria and Latium. 

Pottery has been found on the Capitoline Hill(1750-1350).

#### <u>Final Bronze Age 1200-975 BC</u>

Evidence is more substantial: pottery deposits from Forum, Palantine and Capitoline.

#### <u>Early Iron Age 900 BC</u>

We can find cemeteries with grave goods. Mostly were cremated. There are also remains of a group of 9th, 8th century oval wooden huts with thatched roofs. 

Votive offerings dating to 750-725 proves the religious activity.

Mid to late 8th century a wall at the foot of the hill was made. The position suggests that it was not just for fortification, but to mark boundaries of Palatine settlement. The romans associated it with the ancient boundary of Roma Quadrata which they believe it was founded by Romulus.

### Mythology

There are two distinct strands, each with a long and complicated history: the foundation of Rome by Romulus and Remus and the prequel, which focuses on their ancestor the Trojan hero Aeneas. Perhaps the best-known foundation myths concern Romulus the grandson of Numitor, the king of the Latin city of Alba Longa.

#### <u>Romulus and Remus</u>

There are several variations of this, but in the best-known, Numitor was deposed by  his brother Amulius, and his daughter, Rhea Silvia, was forced to become Vestal Virgin to prevent her marrying and producing a rival heir to the throne. 
Despite this, she became pregnant by the god Mars and gave birth to twin sons, Romulus and Remus. In some versions Amulius gave orders to expose them and leave them to die on of the slopes of the Palatine, but they were suckled by a she-wolf and rescued by a herdsman, Faustulus. They were brought up by Faustulus and his wife, Acca Larentia, and lived as herdsmen until they reached adulthood, when their true origins were revealed. They ejected the usurper Amulius from Alba and reinstated Numitor as king, but then left to found a city of their own on the site of Rome. Remus disappears from the story, killed by his brother during a quarrel in some versions, although there are several variants. 

Romulus then went on to lay out the boundaries of the new city, and in order to increase the population he declared it to be an asylum area - in which displaced or exiled people, criminals fleeing justice or runaway slaves could seek sanctuary and settle. 

Although this increased the size of the settlement, it resulted in a predominantly male population, so, to rebalance this, Romulus invited the people of neighbouring settlements to allow their women to intermarry with the Romans. When these overtures were declined, he used the religious festival of the Consualia, which was attended by people from the area outside Rome, as a pretext to abduct the women of the neighbouring Sabines. Needless to say, this did not endear him to the Sabine men, who sent an army to fetch their womenfolk back. According to Livy, this counter-raid was foiled by the women themselves, who were distressed at the war between their birth families and their new ones, and insisted that the two sides make peace. 

From this point onwards, Romulus reigned as co-ruler along with the Sabine king Titus Tatius. Romulus is credited with an implausibly long reign of thirty-eight years, and many key features of the Roman state are attributed to him. His foundation of the city involved laying out a square boundary, the pomerium, which he marked by a furrow, and which retained huge symbolic significance to Romans. According to Ovid (Fast, 1.25-30), he was responsible for creating the Roman calendar and founding some of the most significant festivals, He is also credited with the division of the Roman people into three tribes and thirty subdivisions of these, known as curiae, creating laws and governing with an advisory council which was the forerunner of the later senate. Finally, he disappeared and was assumed to have been carried off to become a god. After his apotheosis, various cults and festivals in his honour were established.

#### <u>Aeneas</u>

Aeneas role in Rome's foundation can be traced in Roman tradition at least from the time of Ennius and Naevius, writing in the third century BC. Livy (11) briefly recounts how Aeneas, the semi-divine son of the Trojan Anchises and the goddess Venus, escaped from Troy after its sack by the Greeks and sailed to the western Mediterranean accompanied by his son, Ascanius (sometimes also called Iulus) and a group of companions. 

On arriving in Italy, he made an alliance with the local ruler, Latinus, and married Latinus' daughter Lavinia. He became leader of both the native Italians and the Trojans, now collectively renamed Latini (Latins), and founded a new city, Lavinium. A series of wars with other central Italian princes followed, notably against Turnus, king of the Rutuli, and Mezentius, ruler of Caere, during which the Latini gained control of the Alban Hills and the surrounding area. 

After the death of Aeneas, during or shortly after this war, Ascanius became king of the Latins and founded Alba Longa in the Alban Hills as their main city. 

After several generations, during which Alba became established as a major power in Latium, civil war broke out between Numitor and Amulius, brothers and rivals for control of Alba Longa. Numitor was exiled, but his grandsons Romulus and Remus went on to found Rome.

Like the foundation myths about Romulus,the Aeneas myth has a long history in both Greek and Roman culture. There are references to Aeneas journey to Italy in Greek literature and depictions of it in Etruscan Art. Perhaps the most concrete evidence is a hero-shrine to Aeneas that was established at Lavinium by the sixth century.
